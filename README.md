# Half-Tone-Visual-Cryptography
Visual cryptographic schemes (VCS) allow one(at the sender side) to encrypt a secret picture (image) into different share images. Here no share image does uncover any knowledge concerning the original secret image. This work proposes a visual cryptography encryption framework. A color image to be protected is taken as input and then this image is decomposed into three separate monochromatic images based on CMY color space. The computer simulation demonstrates that the visual nature and tone (in terms of quality) of the acquired halftoned shares is acceptable

Visual cryptography, an emerging cryptography technology, uses the characteristics of human vision to decrypt the encrypted images. It does not require the knowledge of cryptography for decryption. For security concerns, it also ensures that hackers cannot perceive any clues about a secret image from individual cover images. Though it has been developed only for binary images, there have been many papers and research articles about its use in grayscale and colored images. Our report explores one such method where an image is a colour decomposed to Cyan, Magenta, Yellow colors and then the visual cryptography is carried out for the individual decomposition.


STEPS:

1.)SAVE all the files in the same directory

2.)Run the CMY.py file

3.)Run Halftone.py file

4.)Run main.py file

5.)Run output.py file

6.)A final image will be saved in the same directory
